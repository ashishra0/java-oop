# Polymorphism

* Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
* The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
* To access the object we need to use a reference variable.
* A reference variable can be of only one type, Once declared the type of reference variable cannot be changed.
* A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type.
