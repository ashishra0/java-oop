# Encapsulation

* It is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts along with inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction.
* It is a mechanism of wrapping up of variables and methods acting on the variables together as a single unit.
* These variables are hidden from other classes and can only be accessed by the methods of the same class.

## To achieve Encapsulation
* Declare the variables of the class as private.
* provide public getter and setter methods to modify and view the variable values.
